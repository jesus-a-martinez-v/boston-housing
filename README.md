This project has been developed as part of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree offered by Udacity. The focus is to gain insight about several model evaluation and validation techniques.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Run

```bash
jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

**Features**
1.  `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-teacher ratio by town

**Target Variable**
4. `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes
